\section{Objectives} \label{rqs}

DFR tools, which come in both metadata-based and file carving variants, are software for recovering deleted data from a digital storage device.
We design experiments to evaluate a selection of DFR tools according to guidelines set by NIST CFTT.
We specifically investigate the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item How well do our selected DFR tools meet each of the NIST CFTT guidelines?
\item What conditions influence the success and failure of DFR tools?
\end{itemize}
