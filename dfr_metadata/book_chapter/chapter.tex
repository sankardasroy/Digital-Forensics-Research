\begin{abstract}
To carry out post-mortem investigation of cyber-crimes, 
professionals use various digital forensics (DF) tools. 
To aid in the standardization of DF tools, 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)’s 
Computer Forensics Tool Testing (CFTT) program 
has compiled a set of expectations for these tools’ behavior. 
DF tools meeting these expectations is critical for the 
integrity of forensic analysis. In this chapter, we focus 
on standardization of Deleted File Recovery (DFR) tools, 
which is a specific class of DF tools. We design a set of 
test images across widely-used file systems. 
We run extensive experiments on these test images as well as 
the test images provided by CFTT to evaluate the DFR tools, 
and to our surprise we find that many DFR tools that are available 
in the market do not fully meet the CFTT expectations. 
We report a comparative evaluation of these tools per CFTT 
expectations, which could help the user choose the right tool. 
We also identify the factors which may result in a failure for DFR tools, and
reflect on the applicability of the CFTT expectations. 
We hope that our current report will trigger more research 
on standardization of DFR tools from the researcher community.
